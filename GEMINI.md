# Gemini Project Configuration: Work Out Plan

This file provides instructions for Gemini to follow when assisting with this project.

## Project Overview

This is a personal workout and diet plan documentation project. It uses MkDocs to generate a static site from Markdown files. The plans are organized into directories for each person (e.g., `docs/hidetoshi`, `docs/nevaeh`).

## Key Technologies

- **Static Site Generator:** MkDocs
- **Content:** Markdown (`.md`)

## File and Directory Structure

- All workout plans are located under the `docs/` directory.
- Each person has their own subdirectory (e.g., `docs/hidetoshi/`).
- The main entry point for the site is `docs/index.md`.

## Content and Naming Conventions

When creating new workout files, please adhere to the following naming convention:

`[ICON] [Day of the Week] · [Workout Focus].md`

- **ICON:** An emoji representing the type of workout (e.g., 🏋️, 🏃, 🧘).
- **Day of the Week:** e.g., 周一, 周二 (Monday, Tuesday).
- **Workout Focus:** A brief, descriptive title of the workout session.

**Example:** `🏋️ 周一 · 力量训练 A：基础力量强化日.md`

## General Instructions

- When adding new plans, create a new Markdown file following the naming convention above in the appropriate person's directory.
- Ensure all Markdown is well-formatted and easy to read.
- If asked to modify a plan, edit the existing corresponding file.
- The primary language for the content is Chinese.
